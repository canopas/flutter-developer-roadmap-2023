The Flutter Developer Roadmap 2023 includes **Practical exercises** that cover all the essential concepts used in day-to-day development.
# Guidelines

- Before starting any practical it's important to conduct research and learn the necessary concepts.

- As you progress through the practical exercises, make sure to apply the new knowledge you've gained in subsequent exercises. Try to allocate no more than 3-4 days to each practical.

- To keep track of your progress and share your work with your team lead, create a repository on GitLab where you can upload your completed exercises for review.

- To stay organized and track your progress, create tickets on ClickUp for each practical exercise. Each ticket should include a detailed description of the exercise, as well as an estimate of story points.

- As you work on each practical exercise, move the corresponding ticket from the "To-Do" queue to the "Done" queue to keep track of your progress. This will help you stay focused and motivated as you work through the roadmap.
